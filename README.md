# Chrome Extension `manifest.json` Dataset (>100K Extensions)

This repository contains >100K [`manifest.json`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) files extracted from Chrome extensions from the [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). These extensions were enumerated by doing a recursive spidering and search result scraping of the Chrome store.

This is a point-in-time extraction and is not up to date with the latest extensions releases. It's meant to be useful for analysis of the Chrome extension ecosystem, such as what permissions are requested, common Content Security Policies, etc.
